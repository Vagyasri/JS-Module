# Code editor pro tips

## Learning objectives

- Use shortcuts in your IDE of choice to increase the speed of development.

### Estimated time: 0.5h

## Go deeper with your editor

In this lesson we will discuss lesser-known features or ways to customize your code editor or IDE to improve your speed and productivity with the editor.

### Why is this important?

Coding quickly is essential in interviews, which are timed. Your interviewer wants to see you code, and the more fluent you are with ways to write code quickly, the more impressed they will be with your coding skills, and therefore the more likely they are to offer you a job.

Think of your code editor the way a musician thinks of their instrument: the more you practice with it and the more advanced techniques you learn, the more likely you will be to dazzle your audience with your talent in your performance.

### Keyboard shortcuts

Aside from learning how to type very quickly, your next best ally in becoming a fast coder is keyboard shortcuts. For example, in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), if you create a file with a `.html` extension, you can type an [Emmet abbreviation](https://docs.emmet.io/abbreviations/) like `html:5` and then hit the tab key to get an entire skeleton of a webpage built for you, complete with a `DOCTYPE`, `<html>` tag, `<head>` tag, `<body>` tag, etc without having to remember how to lay all that out yourself, or — most importantly — without having to make your interviewer sit and wait while you type it out `v e r y . . . s l o w l y . . .` 

### Autocomplete

Your next best way to increase your speed as you type is to take advantage of autocomplete, often referred to as [IntelliSense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_code_completion). For example, when coding JavaScript, if you want to use `document.querySelector` to find an element on the page, in most code editors, all you will likely need to do is type `doc`, press the tab key to autocomplete it to `document`, then type `.queryS`, and press the tab key to autocomplete it to `querySelector`. While it may not seem like saving yourself from typing ten or so keys would improve speed much, those seconds can add up to minutes quickly in an hour-long coding session, which can buy you precious time in an interview situation where minutes can make the difference between possibly solving the exercise or not solving it in time.

### Editor extensions

Most code editors have extension systems that let you add useful features to your editor to speed things up in various ways. Extensions can be used to add more keyboard shortcuts, more autocomplete features, or other conveniences. You should take some time to look at lists of popular extensions, such as [Top 10 VS Code extensions for 2021](https://blog.logrocket.com/top-10-vs-code-extensions-2021/) and install anything that looks like it might speed up your workflow.

### What fast coding looks like

As you practice and improve your coding skills each day, your goal should be to eventually attain speed that is similar to what is shown in this video: [https://www.loom.com/share/74311be5c36140708a02da9f7f04732b](https://www.loom.com/share/74311be5c36140708a02da9f7f04732b).

After enough practice, if you are able to code that quickly and display as much fluency with and mastery of your code editor as that video, then you will likely convince your interviewer that you have a lot of experience working on coding problems and therefore are likely to able to handle the work they are hiring for.
