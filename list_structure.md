# To Do list: list structure

## Learning objectives
- Use webpack to bundle JavaScript.
- Learn how to use proper ES6 syntax.
- Use ES6 modules to write modular JavaScript.

### Estimated time: 3.5h

## Description
In this project, you will build a simple HTML list of *To Do* tasks. The list will be styled according to the specifications listed later in this lesson. This simple web page will be built using webpack and served by a webpack dev server.

*IMPORTANT NOTE: Read **all** requirements before you start building your project.*

### Project requirements
- Set up a new project with webpack that is based on the webpack exercise you have already completed.
- Create an **index.html** file and write your HTML markup here. Create an empty **To Do List** placeholder (`<div>` or `<ul>` element). The **index.html** file must be set as a template using the *HTML Webpack Plugin*.
- Create an **index.js** file and set an array of some simple *to do tasks* (array of objects). Each task object should contain three keys: 
  1. description [`string`].
  2. completed [`bool`].
  3. index: [`number`].
- Write a function to iterate over the tasks array and populate an HTML list item element for each task.
- On page load render the dynamically created list of tasks in the dedicated placeholder. The list should appear in order of the `index` values for each task.
- Create a **style.css** and set rules for the **To Do List**. CSS must be loaded by *Webpack Style/CSS Loader*. Your list should be a clone of the part of the minimalist project captured in the video below.

- All your source files (**index.html**, **index.js** and **style.css**) must be located in */src* directory and your distribution files will be generated by webpack and served by *webpack dev server* from */dist* folder.

# Additional requirements
*These are all optional, but if you're interested in exploring this topic further, feel free to implement them. Any exploration here should be done outside program time.*

*If you decide to implement these requirements you should do it in a separate pull request. As always, remember to clearly document your decision in GitHub comments.*
- Once you're done with the task, you might want to personalize the styling for the list.
