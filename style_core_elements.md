# Awesome books: style core elements

## Learning objectives

- Understand how to use medium-fidelity wireframes to create a UI.

### Estimated time: 4.5h

## Description

In this project, you will add CSS styles to the Awesome books application.

*IMPORTANT NOTE: Read **all** requirements before you start building your project.*

### HTML/CSS requirements

- Follow our list of the [best practices for HTML & CSS](https://github.com/Vagyasri/JS-Module/blob/dev/html_css_best_practices.md).

### Project requirements

- Add CSS styles to the application to make it match this wireframe:
<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/awesome_books_core_elements.png" alt="Basic UI"  width="300px"/>
</p>

- You can use the styles of your choice (colors, fonts, backgrounds, etc.), but try to follow the general layout.
- Concentrate on the general layout, rather than the details.
- You can use plain CSS or a CSS framework (like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)) if you prefer.
