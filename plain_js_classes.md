# Awesome books: refactor to use JavaScript classes

## Learning objectives

- Use JavaScript classes.

### Estimated time: 3h

## Description

In this project, you will refactor the **Awesome books** application to use JavaScript `classes`.

*IMPORTANT NOTE: Read **all** requirements before you start building your project.*

### Project requirements

- Use JavaScript `classes` instead of `objects` and `arrays`.
  - You can use objects and arrays, but do it *inside* classes.
- Create class `methods` to add and remove books.
- Maintain all of the original functionality of the application (i.e. no bugs were introduced while refactoring).
- Don't use any library or framework, use only plain JavaScript.
